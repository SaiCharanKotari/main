                        <p>In this project, I built a blogging platform where users can post articles, comment, and interact. I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end, along with a simple back-end.</p>

                        <p>This project allows users to upload their resumes and analyze them with AI. It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to extract relevant data from resumes and suggest improvements. Built using JavaScript and Node.js.</p>

                        <p>A simple digital clock and stopwatch built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It uses real-time data and allows users to time events with start, stop, and reset features.</p>

                        <p>This is an automatic image slider that transitions between images using JavaScript and CSS animations. It automatically loops through images, ideal for carousels in websites.</p>

                        <h3>Project 5: Another Automatic Slider</h3>
                        <p>This project is similar to Project 4 but with additional features like image captions and dynamic slide durations. It's a great example of working with JavaScript events and CSS transitions.</p>
